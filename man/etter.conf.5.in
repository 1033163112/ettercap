.SH NAME
.B etter.conf 
\- Ettercap configuration file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "etter.conf"
is the configuration file that determines the ettercap behaviour. It is always loaded
at startup and it configures some attributes used at runtime.
.LP
The file contains entries of the form:
.RS
.nf
.ft B
.sp
[section]
.ft B
entry = value
.I "..."
.ft R
.fi
.RE
.LP
Each entry defines a variable that can be customized. Every value MUST be an
integer. Sections are used only to group together some variables.
.Sp
.B NOTE: 
if you omit a variable in the conf file, it will be initialized with the
value 0. It is strongly discouraged to not initialize some critical variable
such as "arp_poison_delay" or "connection_timeout".
.LP
The following is a list of available variables:


.TP 20
.B [privs]
.TP
.B ec_uid
This variable specifies the UID to drop the privileges on startup. After the
socket at link layer has been opened the privileges are dropped to a specific
uid different from root for security reasons. etter.conf is the only file that
is read with root privs. Be sure the uid has enough privs to read other files (etter.*)
You can bypass this variable by setting the environment variable EC_UID.



.TP 20
.B [mitm]
.TP
.B arp_storm_delay
The value represent the millisecond to wait between to packets on the initial
ARP scan. You can increment this value to be less aggressive on startup. The
randomized scan plus an high delay can fool some type of ARP scan detectors.

.TP
.B arp_poison_warm_up
When the poisoning process starts, the inter-packet delay is low for the first
5 poisons (to be sure the poisoning process has been successful). After the
first 5 poisons, the delay is incremented (to keep up the poisoning). This
variable controls the delay for the first 5 poisons. The value is in seconds.
.br
The same delay is use when the victims are restored to the original associations
(RE-ARPing) when ettercap is closed.

.TP
.B arp_poison_delay
This variable controls the poisoning delay after the first 5 poisons. The
value is expressed in seconds. You can increase this value (to try fool the
IDS) up to the timeout of the ARP cache (it depends on the operating system
poisoned).

.TP
.B arp_poison_icmp
Enable the sending of a spoofed ICMP message to force the targets to make an
arp request. This will create an arp entry in the host's cache, so ettercap
will be able to win the race condition and poison the target. Useful against
targets that don't accept gratuitous arp if the entry is not in the cache.

.TP
.B arp_poison_reply
Use ARP replies to poison the targets. This is the classic attack.

.TP
.B arp_poison_request
Use ARP request to poison the targets. Useful against targets that cache even
arp request values.

.TP
.B dhcp_lease_time
This is the lease time (in seconds) for a dhcp assignment. You can lower this
value to permit the victims to receive a correct dhcp reply after you have
stopped your attack. Using higher timeout can seriously mess your network after
the attack has finished. On the other and some clients will prefer higher lease
time, so you have to increase it to win the race condition with the real
erver.

.TP
.B port_steal_delay
This is the delay time (in milliseconds) between stealing packets for the 
"port" mitm method. With low delays you will be able to intercept more
packets, but you will generate more traffic. You have to tune this value
depending on full/half duplex channels, network drivers and adapters,
network general configuration and hardware, to find a good balance between
the number of intercepted packets, re-transmitted packets and lost packets.

.TP
.B port_steal_send_delay
This is the delay time (in microseconds) between packets when the 
"port" mitm method have to re-send packets queues. As said for port_steal_delay
you have to tune this option to the lowest acceptable value.

.TP 20
.B [connections]
.TP
.B connection_timeout
Every time a new connection is discovered by ettercap, it allocate the needed
structures. After a customizable timeout, you can free this structures to keep
the memory usage low. This variable represent this timeout. The value is
expressed in seconds. This timeout is applied even to the session tracking
system (the protocol state machine for dissectors).

.TP
.B connection_idle
The number of seconds to wait before a connection is marked as IDLE.

.TP
.B connection_buffer
This variable controls the size of the buffer linked to each connection.
Every sniffed packet is added to the buffer and when the buffer is full the
older packets are deleted to make room for the newer one. This buffer is useful
to view data that went on the cable before you select to view a specific
connection. The higher is this value, the higher is the ettercap memory occupation.
By the way, the buffer is dynamic, so if you set a buffer of 100.000 byte it is not
allocated all together at the first packet of a connection, but it is filled as
the packets arrive.

.TP
.B connect_timeout
The timeout in seconds when using the connect() syscall. Increase it if you get
a "Connection timeout" error. This option has nothing to do with connections
sniffed by ettercap. It is a timeout for the connections made by ettercap to
other hosts (for example when fingerprinting remote host).



.TP 20
.B [stats]
.TP
.B sampling_rate
Ettercap keeps some statistics on the processing time of the bottom half (the
sniffer) and top half (the protocol decoder). This statistics are made on the
average processing time of sampling_rate packets. You can decrease this value to have
a more accurate real-time picture of processing time or increase it to have a
smoother picture. The total average will not change, but the worst value will
be heavily influenced by this value.



.TP 20
.B [misc]
.TP
.B close_on_eof
When reading form a dump file and using console or daemon UI, this variable is
used to determine what action has to be done on EOF. It is a boolean value. If
set to 1 ettercap will close itself (useful in scripts) else the session will
continue till the user input.

.TP
.B store_profiles
Ettercap collects in memory a profile for each host it detects. Users and
passwords are collected there. If you want to run ettercap in background
logging all the traffic, you may want to disable the collecting in memory to
save system memory. Set this option to 0 (zero) to disable profiles collection.
A value of 1 will enable collection for all the hosts, 2 will collect only
local hosts and 3 only remote hosts (an host is considered remote if it does
not belong to the netmask).

.TP
.B aggressive_dissectors
Some dissectors (such as SSH and HTTPS) needs to modify the payload of the
packets in order to collect passwords and perform a decryption attack. If you
want to disable all the "dangerous" dissector at a time, set this value to 0.

.TP
.B skip_forwarded_pcks
If you set this value to 0 you will sniff even packets forwarded by ettercap
or by the kernel. It will generate packets duplicates in conjuction with
arp mitm method (for example). It could be useful while running ettercap
in unoffensive mode on a host with more than one netwrok interface
(waiting for the multiple-interface feature...)   

.TP 20
.B [dissectors]
.TP
.B protocol_name
This value represent the port on which the protocol dissector has to be bound. A
value of 0 will disable the dissector. The name of the variable is the same of
the protocol name. You can specify non standard port for each dissector as well
as multiple ports. The syntax for multiport selection is the following:
port1,port2,port3,...
.br
NOTE: some dissectors are compiled in conditionally. this means that depending
on the library found in your system some dissectors will be enable and some
other not. by default etter.conf is filled with all the supported dissector. if
you got an "FATAL: Dissector "xxx" does not exists (etter.conf line yy)" error,
you have to comment out the yy line in etter.conf.
