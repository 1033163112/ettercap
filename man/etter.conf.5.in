.SH NAME
.B etter.conf 
\- Ettercap configuration file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "etter.conf"
is the configuration file that determines the ettercap behaviour. It is always loaded
at startup and it configures some attributes used at runtime.
.LP
The file contains entries of the form:
.RS
.nf
.ft B
.sp
[section]
.ft B
entry = value
.I "..."
.ft R
.fi
.RE
.LP
Each entry defines a variable that can be customized. Every value MUST be an
integer. Sections are used only to group together some variables.
.Sp
.B NOTE: 
if you omit a variable in the conf file, it will be initialized with the
value 0. It is strongly discouraged to not initialize some critical variable
such as "arp_poison_delay" or "connection_timeout".
.LP
The following is a list of available variables:


.TP 20
.B [privs]
.TP
.B ec_uid
This variable specifies the UID to drop the priviledges on startup. After the
socket at link layer has been opened the priviledges are dropped to a specific
uid different from root for security reasons. etter.conf is the only file that
is read with root privs. Be sure the uid has enough privs to read other files (etter.*)
You can bypass this variable by setting the evironment variable EC_UID.


.TP 20
.B [net]
.TP
.B arp_storm_delay
The value represent the millisecond to wait between to packets on the initial
ARP scan. You can increment this value to be less aggressive on startup. The
randomized scan plus an high delay can fool some type of ARP scan detectors.

.TP
.B arp_poison_warm_up
When the poisoning process startup the inter packet delay is low for the first
10 seconds (to be sure the poisoning process has been successful). After the
first 10 seconds the delay is incremented (to keep up the poisoning). This
variable controls the delay for the first 10 seconds. The value is in seconds.

.TP
.B arp_poison_delay
This variable controls the poisoning delay after the first 10 seconds. The
value is expressed in seconds. You can increase this value (to try fool the
IDS) up to the timeout of the ARP cache (it depends on the operating system
poisoned).


.TP 20
.B [connections]
.TP
.B connection_timeout
Every time a new connection is discovered by ettercap, it allocate the needed
structures. After a customizable timeout, you can free this structures to keep
the memory usage low. This variable represent this timeout. The value is
expressed in seconds. This timeout is applied even to the session tracking
system (the protocol state machine for dissectors).


.TP 20
.B [stats]
.TP
.B sampling_rate
Ettercap keeps some statistics on the processing time of the bottom half (the
sniffer) and top half (the protocol decoder). This statistics are made on the
everage processing time of sampling_rate packets. You can decrease this value to have
a more accurate real-time picture of processing time or increase it to have a
smoother picture. The total average will not change, but the worst value will
be heavily influenced by this value.


.TP 20
.B [dissectors]
.TP
.B protocol_name
This value represent the port on wich the protocol dissector has to be bound. A
value of 0 will disable the dissector. The name of the variable is the same of
the protocol name. You can specify non standard port for each dissector as well
as multiple ports. The syntax for multiport selection is the following:
port1,port2,port3,...
