.TH ETTERCAP-PLUGINS "8" "" "ettercap @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
.B ettercap-plugins @VERSION@ \- A collection of plugins for ettercap

.SH DESCRIPTION
Ettercap(8) supports loadable modules at runtime. They are called plugins and
they come within the source tarball. They are automatically compiled if your
system supports them or until you specify the --disable-plugins option to the
configure script.

.TP
To have a list of plugins installed in your system do that command:
.Sp
.I ettercap -P list

.LP

The following is a list of available plugins:

.TP 
.B dummy
.Sp
Only a template to demonstrate how to write a plugin.

.TP 
.B finger
.Sp
Uses the passive fingerprint capabilities to fingeerprint a remote host. It
does a connect() to the remote host to force the kernel to reply
to the SYN with a SYN+ACK packet. The reply will be collected and the
fingerprint is displayed. The connect() obey to the connect_timeout parameter
in etter.conf(5). You can specify a target on commandline or let the plugin ask
the target host to be fingerprinted. You can also specify multiple target with
the usual multi-target specification (see ettercap(8)), but only one port at a
time can be used.
.Sp
.I example :
.Sp
ettercap -TzP finger /192.168.0.1/22
.br
ettercap -TzP finger /192.168.0.1-50/22


.TP 
.B finger_submit
.Sp
Use this plugin to submit a fingerprint to the ettercap website. If you found
an unknown fingerprint, but you know for sure the operating system of the
target, you can submit it so it will be inserted in the database in the next
ettercap release. We need your help to increase the passive fingerprint
database. Thank you very much.
.Sp
.I example :
.Sp
ettercap -TzP finger_submit


.TP 
.B link_type
.Sp
It performs a check of the link type (hub or switch) by sending a spoofed ARP
request and listening for replies. It needs at least one entry in the host 
list to perform the check. With two or more hosts the test will be more 
accurate.
.Sp
.I example :
.Sp
ettercap -TP link_type /192.168.0.1/
.br
ettercap -TP link_type //


.TP 
.B smb_clear
.Sp
It forces the client to send smb password in clear-text by mangling protocol 
negotiation. You have to be in the "middle" of the connection to succesfully
use it. It hooks the smb dissector, so you have to keep it active. 
If you use it against a windows client it will probably result in a failure. 
Try it against a *nix smbclient :)
   

.TP 
.B smb_down
.Sp
It forces the client to not to use NTLMv2 password exchange during smb 
authentication. This way, obtained hashes can be easily cracked by LC4.
