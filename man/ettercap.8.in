\- A multipurpose sniffer/content filter for man in the middle attacks

.SH ***** IMPORTANT NOTE ******
Since ettercap NG (formerly 0.7.0), all the options have been changed. Even the target
specification have been changed. \fIPlease read carefully this man page.\fR

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ettercap
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fITARGET1\fR] [\fITARGET2\fR]
.PP
\fITARGET\fR is in the form \fIMAC/IPs/PORTs\fR
.br
where IPs and PORTs are range (e.g. /192.168.0.1-30,40,50/20,22,25)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Ettercap was born as a sniffer for switched LAN (and obviously even "hubbed" one),
but during the development process it has gained more and more features that have
changed it to a powerful and flexible tool for man-in-the-middle attacks.
It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols (even ciphered ones)
and includes many features for network and host analysis (such as OS fingerprint).
.PP
It has two main sniffing options:
.PP
\fIUNIFIED\fR, this method sniff all the packets that pass on the cable. You can choose to put or not the
interface in promisc mode (-p option). The packet not directed to the host
running ettercap will be forwarded automatically using layer 3 routing. So you
can use a mitm attack launched from a different tool and let ettercap modify the
packets and forward them for you. You can also run it on a gateway.
.PP
\fIBRIDGED\fR, it uses two network interfaces and forward the traffic from one to the other
while performing sniffing and content filtering. This sniffing method is
totally stealthy since there is no way to find that someone is in the middle on
the cable.  You can look at this method as a mitm attack at layer 1.
.PP
You can also perform man in the middle attacks while using the unified
sniffing. You can choose the mitm attack that you prefer. The mitm
attack module is independent from the sniffing and filtering process, so you can
launch several attack at the same time or use your own tool for the attack. The
crucial point is that the packets have to arrive to ettercap with the correct
mac address and a different ip address (only these packets will be forwarded).
.PP
The most relevant ettercap features are:
.PP
.B Characters injection in an established connection :
you can inject character to server (emulating commands) or to client (emulating replies)
maintaining the connection alive !!
.PP
.B SSH1 support :
you can sniff User and Pass, and even the data of an SSH1 connection. ettercap is the
first software capable to sniff an SSH connection in FULL-DUPLEX
.PP
.B HTTPS support :
you can sniff http SSL secured data... and even if the connection is made through a PROXY
.PP
.B Remote traffic sniffing through GRE tunnel:
you can sniff remote traffic through a GRE tunnel from a remote cisco router
and make mitm attack on it
.PP
.B Plug-ins support :
You can create your own plugin using the ettercap's API.
.PP
.B Password collector for :
TELNET, FTP, POP, RLOGIN, SSH1, ICQ, SMB, MySQL, HTTP, NNTP, X11, NAPSTER, IRC, RIP, BGP,
SOCKS 5, IMAP 4, VNC, LDAP, NFS, SNMP, HALF LIFE, QUAKE 3, MSN, YMSG (other protocols coming soon...)
.PP
.B Packet filtering/dropping:
You can set up a filter chain that search for a particular string (even hex) in the TCP
or UDP payload and replace it with yours or drop the entire packet.
.PP
.B Passive OS fingerprint:
you scan passively the lan (without sending any packet) and gather detailed info about
the hosts in the LAN: Operating System, running services, open ports, IP, mac address
and network adapter vendor.
.PP
.B Kill a connection:
from the connections list you can kill all the connections you want
.PP
.B Bind sniffed data to a local port
You can connect to that port with a client and decode unknown protocols or
inject data to it (only in arp based mode)


.SH TARGET SPECIFICATION
There is no concept of SOURCE nor DEST. The two target are intended to filter
traffic coming from one to the other and viceversa (since the connection is
bidirectional).
.PP
\fITARGET\fR is in the form \fIMAC/IPs/PORTs\fR. If you want you can omit any of its parts
and this will represent an ANY in that part. 
.br
e.g.
.br
"//80" means ANY mac address, ANY ip and ONLY port 80
.br
"/10.0.0.1/" means ANY mac address, ONLY ip 10.0.0.1 and ANY port
.PP
\fIMAC\fR must be unique and in the form 00:11:22:33:44:55
.PP
\fIIPs\fR is a range of IP in dotted notation. You can specify range with the - (hyphen)
and single ip with , (comma). You can also use ; (semicolon) to indicate
different ip addresses.
.br
e.g.
.br
"10.0.0.1-5;10.0.1.33" expands into ip 10.0.0.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10.0.1.33
.PP
\fIPORTs\fR is a range of PORTS. You can specify range with the - (hyphen) and single port 
with , (comma).
.br
e.g.
.br
"20-25,80,110" expands into ports 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 80 and 110
.PP
.B NOTE:
.br
you can reverse the matching of the TARGET by adding the -R option to the
command line. So if you want to sniff ALL the traffic BUT the one coming or
going to 10.0.0.1 you can specify "./ettercap -R /10.0.0.1/"
.PP
.B NOTE:
.br
TARGETs are also responsible of the initial scan of the lan. you can use them
to restrict the scan to only a subset of the hosts in the netmask. the result
of the merging between the two target will be scanned. remember that not
specifing a target means "no target", but specifing "//" means "all the host in
the subnet.
.PP


.SH PRIVILEGES DROPPING
ettercap needs root privileges to open the Link Layer sockets. After the
initialization phase, the root privs are not needed anymore, so ettercap drop
them to UID = 65535 (nobody). Since ettercap has to write (create) log files,
it must be executed in a directory with the right permissions (e.g. /tmp/). If
you want to drop privs to a different uid, you can export the environment
variable EC_UID witht the value of the uid you want to drop the privs to (e.g.
export EC_UID=500) or set the correct parameter in the etter.conf file.



.SH OPTIONS
Options that make sense together can generally be combined. ettercap will warn the user
about unsupported option combinations.
.TP
.B SNIFFING AND ATTACK OPTIONS
.PP
ettercap NG has a new unified sniffing method. This implies that ip_forwarding
in the kernel is always disabled and the forwarding is done by ettercap. Every
packet with destination mac address equal to the host's mac address and
destination ip address different for the one bound to the iface will be
forwarded by ettercap. Before forwarding them, ettercap can content filter,
sniff, log or drop them. It does not matter how these packet are hijacked,
ettercap will process them. You can even use external program to hijack
packet.
.br
You have full control of what ettercap should receive. You can use the internal
mitm attacks, set the interface in promisc mode, use plugins or use every
method you want.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-mitm <METHOD:ARGS>\fR
MITM attack 
.br
This option will activate the man in the middle attack. The mimt attack is
totally independent from the sniffing. The aim of the attack is to hijack
packets and redirect them to ettercap. The sniffing engine will forward them if
necessary.
.br
You can choose the mitm attack that you prefer and also combine some of them to
perform different attacks at the same time.
.br
If a mitm method requires some parameters you can specify them after the colon.
(e.g.  -M dhcp:ip_pool,netmask,ecc )
.Sp
The following mitm attack are available:
.RS
.TP
\fBarp\fR ([remote],[oneway])
This method implement the ARP poisoning mitm attack. ARP
request/reply are sent to the victims to poison their ARP cache. Once the cache
has been poisoned the victims will send all packets to the attacker which, in
turn, can modify them and forward to the real destination.
.Sp
In silent mode (-z option) only the first target is selected, if you want to
poison multiple target in silent mode use the -j option to load a list from a
file.
.Sp
You can select empty targets and they will be expanded as 'ANY' (all the host in
the LAN). The target list is joined with the hosts list (created by the arp
scan) and the result is used to determine the victims of the attack.
.Sp
The parameter "remote" is optional and you have to specify it if you want to
sniff remote ip address poisoning a gateway. Indeed if you specify a victim and
the gw in the TARGETS, ettercap will sniff only connection between them, but to
enable ettercap to sniff connections that passes thru the gw, you have to use
this parameter.
.Sp
The parameter "oneway" will force ettercap to poison only from TARGET1 to
TARGET2. Useful if you want to poison only the client and not the router (where
an arp watcher can be in place).
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
the targets are: /10.0.0.1-5/ /10.0.0.15-20/
.br
and the host list is: 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.16 10.0.0.18
.Sp
the associations between the victims will be:
.br
1 and 16, 1 and 18, 3 and 16, 3 and 18
.Sp
if the targets overlap each other, the association with identical ip address
will be skipped.
.Sp
NOTE: if you manage to poison a client, you have to set correct routing
table in the kernel specifying the GW. If your routing table are incorrect, the
poisoned clients will not be able to navigate the Internet.


.TP
\fBicmp\fR (MAC/IP/) 
This attack implements ICMP redirection. It sends a spoofed icmp redirect
message to the hosts in the lan pretending to be a best route for internet. All
the connections to internet will be redirected to the attacker which, in turn,
will forward them to the real gateway.
.br
You have to pass as argument the MAC and the IP address of the real gateway for the lan.
.br
Obviously you have to be able to sniff all the traffic. If you are on a switch
you have to use a different mitm attack such as arp poisoning.
.Sp
NOTE: to restrict the redirection to a given target, specify it as a TARGET
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
-M icmp:00:11:22:33:44:55/10.0.0.1/
.Sp
will redirect all the connections that pass thru that gateway.


.TP
\fBdhcp\fR 
XXX-TODO 

.RE

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-only-mitm\fR
This options disables the sniffing thread and enable only the mitm attack.
Useful if you want to use ettercap to perform mitm attacks and another sniffer
(such as ethereal) to sniff the traffic. Keep in mind that the packet are not
forwarded by ettercap. The kernel will be responsible for the forwarding.
Rebember to activate the "ip forwarding" feature in your kernel.

.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-bridge <IFACE>\fR
BRIDGED sniffing
.br
You need two network interfaces. ettercap will forward form one to the other
all the traffic it sees. It is useful for man in the middle at the physical
layer. It is totally stealthy since it is passive and there is no way for an
user to see the attacker.
.br
You can content filter all the traffic as you were a transparent proxy for the
"cable".


.TP
.B OFF LINE SNIFFING
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-read <FILE>\fR
OFF LINE sniffing 
.br
With this option enabled, ettercap will sniff packets from a pcap compatible
file instead of capturing from the wire.
.br
This is useful if you have a file dumped from tcpdump or ethereal and you want
to make an analysis (search for passwords or passive fingerprint) on it.
.br
Obviously you cannot use "active" sniffing (arp poisoning or bridging) while
sniffing from a file.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-write <FILE>\fR
WRITE packet to a pcap file
.br
This is useful if you have to use "active" sniffing (arp poison) on a switched
LAN but you want to analyze the packets with tcpdump or ethereal. You can use
this option to dump the packets to a file and then load it into your favourite
application.
.Sp
NOTE: dump file collect ALL the packets disregarding the TARGET. This is done
because you may want to log even protocols not supported by ettercap, so you
can analyze them with other tools.


.TP
.B USER INTERFACES OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
The text only interface, only printf ;)
.br
It is quite interactive, press 'h' in every moment to get the help of what you
can do.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode. It can be used only in conjunction with the console interface. It
does not print packet content. It is useful if you want to convert pcap file to
ettercap log files.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
ettercap -Tq -L dumpfile -r pcapfile

.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-curses\fR
.br

.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-gtk\fR
.br

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-daemonize\fR
.br
Daemonize ettercap. This option will detach ettercap from the current
controlling terminal and set it as a daemon. You can combine this feature with
the "log" option to log all the traffic in the background. If the daemon fail
for any reasons, it will create the file "./ettercap_daemonized.log" in
which is present the error caught by ettercap. Furthermore, if you want to have
a complete debug of the daemon process, you are encouraged to recompile
ettercap in debug mode.



.TP
.B GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-iface <IFACE>\fR
Use this <IFACE> instead of the default one.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-netmask <NETMASK>\fR
Use this <NETMSK> instead of the one associated with the current iface.

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-reversed\fR
Reverse the matching in the TARGET selection. It means not(TARGET). All but the
selected TARGET.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-proto <PROTO>\fR
Sniff only PROTO packets (default is TCP + UDP).
.br
This is useful if you want to select a port via the TARGET specification but
you want to differentiate between tcp or udp.
.br
PROTO can be "tcp", "udp" or "all" for both.

.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Do not perform the initial ARP scan of the LAN.
.Sp
NOTE: you will not have the hosts list, so you can't use the multipoison feature.
you can only select two hosts for an ARP poisoning attack, specifying them
through the TARGETs

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unoffensive\fR
Every time ettercap starts, it disable ip forwarding in the kernel and begin to
forward packets it self. This options prevent to do that, so the responsibility
of ip forwarding is left to the kernel.
.br
This options is useful if you want to run multiple ettercap instances. You will
have one instance (the one without the -u option) forwarding the packets, and
all the other instances doing their work without forwarding them. Else you will
get packet duplicates.
.br
It also disable the internal creation of the sessions for each connection. It
increases performances, but you will lost the possibility to modify packets on
the fly.
.br
If you want to use a mitm attack you have to use a separate instance.

.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-load-hosts <FILENAME>\fR
It can be used to load an hosts list from a file created by the -k option. (see below)

.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-save-hosts <FILENAME>\fR
Saves the hosts list to a file. Useful when you have many hosts and you don't want to
do an ARP storm at startup any time you use ettercap. Simply use this options and dump
the list to a file, then to load the information from it use the -j <filename> option.

.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-plugin <PLUGIN>\fR
Run the selected PLUGIN. Many plugins need target specification, use TARGET as
always.
.br
In console mode (-C option), standalone plugin are executed and then the
application exits. Hook plugin are activated and the normal sniffing is
performed.
.br
To have a list of the available external plugins use "list" (without quotes) as
plugin name (e.g. ./ettercap -P list).
.Sp
NOTE: you can also activate plugins directly from the interfaces (always press
"h" to get the inline help)
.Sp
More detailed info about plugins and about how to write your own are found in
the man page ettercap_plugin(8)

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-filter <FILE>\fR
Load the filter from the file <FILE>. The filter must be compiled with
etterfilter(8). The utility will compile the filter script and produce a binary
filter file compliant for ettercap. Read the etterfilter(8) man page for the
list of function you can use inside a filter script.
.br
NOTE: these filters are different from those set with --pcapfilter. An ettercap
filter is a content filter and can modify the payload of a packet before
forwarding it. Pcap filter are used to capture only certain packets.


.TP
.B VISUALIZATION OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-regex <REGEX>\fR
Handle only packets that match the regex.
.br
This option is useful in conjunction with -L. It logs only packets that match
the posix regex REGEX.
.br
It impacts even on the visualization of the sniffed packets. If it is set only
packet matching the regex will be displayed.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-visual <FORMAT>\fR
Use this option to set the visualization method for the packets to be
displayed.
.Sp
FORMAT may be one of the following:
.Sp

.RS
.TP
\fBhex\fR
Print the packets in hex format.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
the string  "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified"  becomes:
.Sp
0000: 4854 5450 2f31 2e31 2033 3034 204e 6f74  HTTP/1.1 304 Not
.br
0010: 204d 6f64 6966 6965 64                    Modified
   
.TP
\fBascii\fR
Print only "printable" characters, the others are displayed as dots '.'

.TP
\fBtext\fR
Print only the "printable" characters and skip the others.

.TP
\fBebcdic\fR
Convert an EBCDIC text to ASCII.

.TP
\fBhtml\fR
Strip all the html tags from the text. A tag is every string between < and >.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
<title>This is the title</title>, but the following <string> will not be
displayed.
.Sp
This is the title, but the following will not be displayed.
.RE


.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dns\fR
Resolve ip addresses into hostnames. 
.Sp
NOTE: this may seriously slow down ettercap while logging passive informations.
Every time a new host is found, a query to the dns is performed. Ettercap keeps
a cache for already resolved host to increase the speed, but new hosts need a
new query and the dns may take up to 2 or 3 seconds to respond for an unknown
host.
.Sp
HINT: ettercap collects the dns replies it sniffs in the resolution table, so
even if you specify to not resolve the hostnames, some of them will be resolved
because the reply was previously sniffed. think about it as a passive dns 
resolution for free... ;)

.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-ext-headers\fR
Print extended headers for every displayed packet. (e.g. mac addresses)

.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-superquiet\fR
Super quiet mode. Do not print users and passwords as they are collected. Only
store them in the profiles. It can be useful to run ettercap in text only mode
but you don't want to be flooded with dissectors messages. Useful when using
plugins because the sniffing process is always active, it will print all the
collected infos, with this option you can suppress these messages.
.br
NOTE: this options automatically sets the -q option.
.Sp
example:
.Sp
ettercap -TzQP finger /192.168.0.1/22




.TP
.B LOGGING OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log <LOGFILE>\fR
Log all the packet to binary files. These files can be parsed by etterlog(8) to
extract human readable data. With this option will be logged all the packets
that ettercap sniffs and all the passive info (host info + user & pass) it can
collect. Given a LOGFILE, ettercap will create LOGFILE.ecp (for packets) and
LOGFILE.eci (for the infos).
.Sp
NOTE: if you specify this option on command line you don't have to take care of
priviledges since the log file is opened in the startup phase (with high
privs). But if you enable the log option while ettercap is already started, you
have to be in a directory where uid = 65535 or uid = EC_UID can write.
.Sp
NOTE: the logfiles can be compressed with the deflate algorithm using the -c
option.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log-info <LOGFILE>\fR
Very similar to -L but it logs only passive information + users and passwords
for each host. The file will be named LOGFILE.eci

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-log-msg <LOGFILE>\fR
It stores in <LOGFILE> all the user messages printed by ettercap. This can be
useful when you are using ettercap in daemon mode or if you want to track down
all the messages. Indeed, some dissectors prints messages but their
informations are not stored anywhere, so this is the only way to keep track of
them.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR
Compress the logfile with the gzip algorithm while it is dumped. etterlog(8) is
capable of handling both compressed and uncompressed log files.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-only-local\fR
Stores profiles information belonging only to the LAN hosts.
.Sp
NOTE: this option is effective only against the profiles collected in memory.
while logging to a file ALL the host are logged, if you want to split them, use
the related etterlog(8) option.

.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-only-remote\fR
Stores profiles information belonging only to remote hosts.




.TP
.B STANDARD OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-update\fR
Connects to the ettercap website (ettercap.sf.net) and retrieve the latest
databases used by ettercap.
.br
If you want only to check if an update is available, prepend the -z option.
The order does matter: ettercap -zU
.Sp
.B SECURITY NOTE: 
The updates are not signed so an attacker may poison your DNS server 
and force the updateNG.php to feed ettercap with fake databases.
This can harm to your system since it can overwrite any file containing
the string "Revision: ".
                            

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version and exit.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
prints the help screen with a short summary of the available options.

.SH PHILOLOGICAL HISTORY
"Even if blessed with a feeble intelligence, they are cruel and smart..."
this is the description of Ettercap, a monster of the RPG Advanced Dungeons & Dragon.
.PP
The name "ettercap" was chosen because it has an assonance with "ethercap" which
means "ethernet capture" (what ettercap actually does) and also because such
monsters have a powerful poison... and you know, arp poisoning... ;)
.PP
Someone has mailed us :
.br
"Did you know that in Dutch "etter" means "pain in the ass" or "nasty piece
of work". Unfortunately, I think this applies to you, as this software will
be used by numerous script kiddies to hack all kinds of services on local
networks. "
.PP
I think that this is extremely true... ettercap is a "pain in the ass" for
admin-kiddie. There are many way to detect and to protect against ettercap....
The first one is: DON'T GIVE ROOT ACCESS TO SCRIPT-KIDDIES ON YOUR LAN!
Some features were limited intentionally to work only on local network, because
it is easier to protect against them locally.
.br
Internet is not a game, we need qualified admin and programmer to make secure
protocols and programs. It isn't our fault if the net is so insecure... but we
can do something to harden it.
Ettercap was developed with this idea in mind: if even a script kiddies can do an
hijack of the local connections, probably someone will find a solution for that !
