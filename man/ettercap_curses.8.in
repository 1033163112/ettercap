.SH NAME
.B ettercap @VERSION@ \- Man page for the Ncurses GUI.

.SH GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The curses GUI is quite simple and intuitive.
.br
It is menu-driven. Every flag or functions can be modified/called thru the
upper menu. All the user messages are printed in the bottom window. If you want
to see the old messages, you can scroll the window buffer by pressing the UP,
DOWN, PPAGE, NPAGE keys. 
The middle part is used to display informations or dialogs for the user.
.Sp
The menus can be opened by pressing the relative hotkey. For the menus the
hotkey is represented by the uppercase initial letter of the title (e.g. 'S'
for Sniffing, 'T' for Targets). The functions within a menu can be called by
pressing the hotkey depicted near the function name on the right. Hotkeys
prefixed with 'C-' are to be used in conjunction with the CTRL key (e.g. 'C-f'
means CTRL+f).
.Sp
You can switch the focus between the objects on the screen by pressing the TAB
key or by clicking on it with the mouse (if you are running ettercap within an
xterm). Mouse events are supported only thru the xterm. You can use the mouse
to select objects, open a menu, chose a function, scroll the elevators for the
scrolling windows, etc etc.
.Sp
When you open more than one windows in the middle part, they will overlap. Use
the TAB key to switch between them. Use CTRL+Q to close the focused window.
.br
You can also use CTRL+Q to close input dialog if you want to cancel the
requested input. (i.e. you have selected the wrong function and you want to go
back).


.SH HOW TO SELECT IT
To use the ncurses GUI you have to:
.Sp
- compile ettercap with ncurses support (obviously)
.br
- run it with the -C flag 
.Sp
Passing the -C flag is sufficient, but if you want you can pass other flags
that will be automatically set even for the curses GUI. You will be able to
override them using the menu to change the options.


.SH ONCE STARTED
As soon as ettercap is launched with the Ncurses GUI, you will be prompted with
multiple choices. The first screen let you select if you want to open a pcap
file or dump the sniffed traffic to a file, if you want unified sniffing or
bridged one, permits you to set a pcap file on the captured traffic and enables
you to log all the sniffed data.
.Sp
Once you have selected a sniffing method (from file, unified or bridged) this
screen will not be reachable anymore. The only way is to restart ettercap.


Let analyze each menu in the start screen:

.TP 
.B File
.RS
.TP
.B Open...  
Open a pcap file and analyze it. All the functionalities available for live
sniffing are in place except for those sending or forwarding packets (mitm
attacks and so on...).
.TP
.B Dump to file...
All the traffic sniffed by the live capture will be dumped in that file. The
filters nor the targets have effects on this file, all the packets received by
pcap will be dumped. The only way to not dump a certain packet is to set a pcap
filter (see below).
.TP
.B Exit
.br
Exits from ettercap and returns to the command prompt.
.RE



.TP 
.B Sniff
.RS
.TP
.B Unified sniffing...  
Choosing this function you will be prompted to select the network interface to be 
used for sniffing. The first up and running interface is suggested in the input
box.
For an explanation of what unified sniffing is, refer to ettercap(8).
.br.
TIP: if you press 'u' as an hotkey, this step will be skipped and the default
interface is automatically selected.
.TP
.B Bridged sniffing...  
After giving the two interfaces to be used, you will enter the Bridged sniffing
mode. For an explanation of what bridged sniffing is, refer to ettercap(8).
.TP
.B Set pcap filter...
Here you can insert a tcpdump-like filter for the capturing process.
.br
IMPORTANT: if you manage to use a mitm attack, remember that if ettercap does
not see a packet, it will NOT be forwarded. So be sure of what you are doing by
setting a pcap filter.
.RE


.TP 
.B Options
.RS
.TP
.B Unoffensive  
This enable/disable the unoffensive flag. The asterisc '*' means "the option is
enabled" else the option is not enabled.
.TP
.B Promisc mode

This is an "asterisk-option" as the unoffensive one.
