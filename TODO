      - hack_pcap_lnet is not usable
      - bpf filter on outgoing packets
      - BIOCSSEESENT (only under freebsd)

>>> current developmet state 

   + rework the is_open_port

   + TOP HALF
      - passive profiling (almost done in etterlog)
         - user not shown
      - connection tracking (with buffered conn)


   + ARP POISON ENGINE
      - arp poisoner
      - multipoison
      - rearp in demon mode (clean shutdown of all thread)
   
   
   + FILTERING ENGINE
      - use regexp for filtering
      - include all the protocols in the filter rule
         - protocols table
         - parsing engine
            - SP (string pointer)
            - FLAGS (flags
      - filter even the header of the packets
      - use bison and flex
      - scripting language
      - etterfilter (utility) (used to compile the filter in bytecode)
         - cond ? goto : goto
         - action
         - example for ssh filter:
         
            L4.tcp.src == 22 ? 1 : -1
            DATA.data == "1.99" : 2 : -1
            SP <- "1.51"

            or 

            if (L4.tcp.src == 22) {
               if (ptr = search(DATA.data, "1.99")) {
                  subst(ptr, "1.51");
               }
            }
            
   
   + INJECTION

      - WIFI decoder support for WEP (key given)
      
   + PLUGINS
      - convert all the old plugins
      - check for poisoner
      - linktype
      - "active" passive fingerprint
     
   + INTERFACE ENGINE
      - console
      - ncurses
      - gtk
