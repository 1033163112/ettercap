      - cygwin issue (study libltdl)
      - use libldtdl (problems even on openbsd)
      - LTDL_SHLIB_EXT
      - make test with dlopen-test

   + SOLARIS PORTING
      - checksum (WORD_BIGENDIAN on intel ???)

   + BSD PORTING
      - hack_pcap_lnet is not usable
      - bpf filter on outgoing packets

Oct 2003:


   + FILTERING ENGINE
      - pay attention on network order for constants
      - remove the ugly huge buffer for strings
         - pay attention of memcpy in ef_grammar
      - quick filter
      - perl regex (with libpcre) to support:
          s/^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/;     # swap first two words
      
   + INJECTION 
      - it is done by the ui looking the sessions (locking them)
      - don't inject in unoffensive mode
      - don't inject after RST or FIN+ACK


   + DISSECTORS
      - TELNET:
         - fix the initial session
         - empty password
         - only password (for routers)
      - convert all the old dissectors
      - HTTPS without the dirty trick (can we use loopback?)
      - HTTP sniff cookies
      - SSH has to support DES, 3DES, blowfish and zlib compression
      - WIFI decoder support for WEP (key given)
      - PPP decoder
      - DHCP
