   + PO incapsulated ?
   + lnet ptag thread safe (check it)
   + speed up the visualization of user_msg (poll related)

   ?? VBUF functions for dissectors ??
   
   !! dissector malloc the INFO, someone have to free them... !!
   !! dissector malloc the PASSIVE, someone have to free them... !!


   + SNIFFING ENGINE
      - arp sniff
         - arp poisoner
         - layer 3 forwarding
         - only possible on eth
      - bridged sniffing (for now it is one-way)
         - dump on bridge
   
   + PLUGINS ENGINE
   
   + FILTERING ENGINE
      - implement the sessions
      - use regexp for filtering
      - INJECTION is done by the ui looking the sessions (locking them)
   
   + TOP HALF
      - processing engine to differenziate the activity (hook point DISPATCHER)
         - passive mapping
         - sniffing (connection tracking)
         - logging
   
   
   + DISSECTORS
      - all the old dissectors
      - HTTPS without the dirty trick (can we use loopback?)
      
   + INTERFACE ENGINE
      - console
      - daemonized
      - ncurses

   + PORTING TO SUNOS      (TO BE TESTED, TESTED and TESTED...)

      + plugins !!

   + ICQ DISSECTOR v 7

   + create the Align Buffer function ???

==================
  TODO for 0.7.0
==================

   FEATURE FREEZED RELEASE

   + PLUGINS makefile

   + PACKET OBJECT
      better handling of received packet (speed up illithid)

   + REMOVE different struct CONNECTION and SNIFFED_DATA
      unified struct with payload in the heap.
      destroy the heap buffer when displayed or logged

   + VIRTUAL BUFFER 
      for dissectors

   + MULTI DISSECTOR
      - implement a list for dissectors
      - dissector registration on IP_PROTO
         - make special contenitor dissector for TCP and UDP

   + DYNAMIC INTERNAL BUFFERS
   
   + CODE REVIEW
      - illithid (the sniffing engine) must be recoded from scratch
      - doppleganger must be cleaned

   + CODE TUNING
      - Convert some structures to speed up the ncurses interface

   + CONNECTION BUFFER
      - keep track of a buffer of packet of each connection
        so you can view it even if the connection is too fast and it
        is already closed

   + DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION

   + HTTPS dissector to be recoded to support even BSD and MACOS

   + FILTER THE SNIFFED DATA FORM ILLITHID AND NOT FROM INTERFACE.
     - Collector must respect the IP:PORT directive
     - pcapdump must respect the filters
     - everything must respect filter but forwarding

   + GLOBAL OPTIONS
      - interface, ip, mac can be changed at any time
      - give plugins the access to all options (fusys wireless)

   + FILTERS
      - specify even the ip in the filters chain so filters can be
      set even on smart arping non local connection


==================
  TODO for 0.7.x
==================

   + SELECTIVE LOGGING FROM SNIFFING INTERFACE (decoder thread)
      - review the connection array structure

   + Spoof source mac during poisoning for LAN without switch

   + MULTI-POISONING
      - allow multi target in arp based mode
      - hybrid sniffing

   + USE FLEX & BISON 
      - parse the configure file
      - write a scripting language for filters

   + PASSIVE FINGERPRINT
      fix the RT problem

==================
  LONG TERM TODO
==================

   + SFTP
   + FTP-SSL

   + RESEARCH
      - How does VPN work ?
      - How does Kerberos work ?

   + Protocol Injection
      - with ncurses form (different injector for different protocol)

   + NEW DISSECTOR
      - TACACS dissector
      - new netbios
      - postgresql
      - cvs
      - tds

   + Inet
      - handle fragmented packets
      - IPv6 support

   + Ncurses interface
      - better winch handling... (i'm too lazy to do this...)

   + PORTING TO 64 bit ARCH

=================
  TODO NEVER ;)    or very very very long term todo... :)

   + GTK+ interface

   + Kettercap (KDE interface)
