==================

>>> things to be fixed
   
   + FIXING
      - dissect_free_session
      - input for curses gui

   + PCAP RELATED
      + reset the stats when the sniffing thread starts
      + when libpcap 0.8.2 will be released
         - pcap_stat fix (even under linux the stats are cumulative)

   + LNET RELATED
      + when libnet 1.1.2 will be released
         - add support for unconfigured interface

   + SOLARIS PORTING
      - test the bridged sniffing

   + WINDOWS PORTING
      - get_iface_mtu 
      - make the whole thing compile ;)
      - then found all the bugs....
      - dll instead of plugins (argh!)

>>> to be developed...

this is the unofficial and floating in time roadmap:

   + DOCUMENTATION
      - write the requirements for each os
      - how to code a plugin 

   + CURSES GUI
      - regex on the content
      - input for curses_input
      - context sensitive help

   + INJECTION 
      - it is done by the ui looking the sessions (locking them)
      - reset modified connection (on user request)
      - flag to mark encripted connections

   + CONNECTION
      - kill a connection
      - flag for injected/modified connection

   + DISSECTORS
      - convert all the old dissectors:
         - https (over the ssl one)
         - pcanywhere
      - SSL unified dissector for https, impas, pop3s ecc ecc
      - TDS
   
   + PLUGINS
      - automatic add of new hosts
      port all the plugins to NG:
         - lurker    -> find_ettercap
         - golem     -> res_exhaust
         - leech     -> isolate
         - triton    -> gw_discover
